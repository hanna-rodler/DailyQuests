Running automated tests typically depends on the testing framework you're using. Assuming you're using Jest and you have it configured in your project, here's a general guide on how to run your automated tests:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have Jest and any other required dependencies installed. If not, you can install them using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @vue/test-utils
   ```

   This assumes you're using Vue Test Utils for testing Vue components.

2. **Configure Jest:**
   Make sure you have a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js` or `jest.config.ts`) in your project. If not, you can create one. Here's a simple example:

   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest',
   };
   ```

   If you're using TypeScript, you may need additional configurations.

3. **Run Tests:**
   Once everything is set up, you can run your tests. You can run all tests with:

   ```bash
   npx jest
   ```

   Or, to run tests in watch mode (automatically re-runs tests when files change), use:

   ```bash
   npx jest --watch
   ```

   Replace `npx` with `yarn` if you're using Yarn.

4. **Run Specific Tests:**
   If you want to run specific tests or files, you can provide the path to the test file or a pattern:

   ```bash
   npx jest path/to/your/test/file.test.js
   ```

   Adjust the file path based on your project structure.

5. **Explore Additional Options:**
   Jest provides various options for configuration and running tests. You can explore the [official Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) for more advanced configurations and options.

Keep in mind that the commands and configurations might vary depending on your project setup and the testing libraries you use. Adjust them based on your specific project requirements.
